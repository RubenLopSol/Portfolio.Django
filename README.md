# Ruben Lopez Sole's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This web application showcases my skills and features some of my web development projects. It is built using Django rest for the backend and React for the frontend, and it's deployed on Heroku.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React: Building responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
  - Context: State management for control language.
  - Sass / semantic-ui-react: Styles.
  - Fetch: Making asynchronous API requests to the backend.
  - Formik: To manage forms.
  - i18next: To manage the translation into Spanish and English.
  - Lodash: for functions and methods.
  - React-toastify: for manage the alerts.
  - Yup: Validation.

- **Backend**:
  - Django: Powering the server-side logic and data handling.
  - Django REST framework: Creating RESTful APIs.
  - Sqlite3: Storing data persistently.
  - Heroku: Hosting and deployment.
  - Drf-yasg: Documentation.
